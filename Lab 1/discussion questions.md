Why does Windows Server Core use a command-line interface instead of a GUI?



How does PowerShell differ from the traditional command prompt (cmd.exe)?

There are many differences between the two. Powershell was made with the open source .Net Core Framework, allowing it to run on Windows, Linux, and MacOS. CMD runs only on Windows.  CMD outputs plain text, whereas Powershell outputs .Net objects. Powershell scripting(.ps1) is more advanced, supporting functions, loops, and conditionals, whereas CMD(.bat) supports basic commands. Still, many legacy systems still rely on CMD, and it remains ideal for basic tasks.
